Human action recognition using Machine leaning and deploying to Comet.

Human Action Recognition (HAR) is a process of identifying and categorizing human actions from videos or image sequences. It is a challenging task in computer vision, and it has many practical applications, such as video surveillance, human-computer interaction, sports analysis, and medical diagnosis.

## Some use cases
- Healthcare.
- Surveillance and Security.
- Sports and Fitness.
- Robotics.
- Entertainment.

## Tools
- Python
- Comet
- VGG16 model

## The VGG model?
The VGG (Visual Geometry Group) model is a deep convolutional neural network architecture for image recognition tasks. It was introduced in 2014 by a group of researchers from the University of Oxford.
